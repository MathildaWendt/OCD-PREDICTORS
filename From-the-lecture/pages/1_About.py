    This dashboard is designed to provide insights into the severity of OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) symptoms according to the Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) scores. The Y-BOCS scores are used to assess the severity of obsessions and compulsions, to understand the impact of OCD (1).
